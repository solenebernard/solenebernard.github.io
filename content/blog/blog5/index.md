description: "We're hearing more than we're seeing." 
summary: "After diving into color perception in the previous blog post, I got interested into understanding more another sensor that mammals have: hearing. Light is a electromagnetic wave, where sound is a mechanical one, but the comparison is relevant because both sound and light signals can be described as a spectrum of wavelenght."

## Introduction

The cochlea is the part in the inner ear that allows to analyze sound and sending it to the brain. It has a snail-like structure, and is covered by hair cells. The spatial arrangement of the membrane is called *tonotopy* (from Greek *tono* for frequency and *topos* for place).
