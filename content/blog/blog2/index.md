## Introduction

Recently, I read an article claiming that the color pink doesn't exist, and is only an illusion from our brain. Because I struggle to accept this idea, this is the motivation into diving in the understanding of the human perception of colors. 

### Cones 

The perception of light is due to photoreceptors cells, called cone and rod cells. Rod cells gives low intensity light perception, and cones cells gives high intensity light perception. Most humans have three kinds of cones, each sensitive to a different spectrum of lights, and the combination of those three signals analyzed by our brain gives the sensation of light.

From data collected from http://cvrl.ucl.ac.uk/cones.htm , we can plot the different sensitivy of those three cones, sensitives to either small ($S_S$), medium ($S_M$) or long ($S_L$) wavelenghts.

#### Cones responses to any light spectrums

For each wavelength $\lambda$, the contribution to the cone's response is the product of the light's intensity $I(\lambda)$ and the cone's sensitivity $S(\lambda)$ at that wavelength.

<!-- 
Mathematically: $R = \int I(\lambda) S(\lambda) \, d\lambda$, where:
+ $R$ is the total cone response,
+ $I(\lambda)$ is the intensity of the light at wavelength $\lambda$,
+ $S(\lambda)$ is the sensitivity of the cone to that wavelength.

If the light consists of discrete wavelengths (e.g., lasers or narrowband sources), you can sum the contributions from each wavelength:

$$ R = \sum_{i} I(\lambda_i) S(\lambda_i),$$

where $I(\lambda_i)$ and $S(\lambda_i)$ are the intensity and sensitivity at each discrete wavelength $\lambda_i$. -->

## The space of possible cone responses

Because the sensitivy curve overlap, not all possible triplets $\{S_S(I(\lambda)), S_M(I(\lambda)), S_L(I(\lambda))\}$ can be reached. 

### Space of monochromatic stimulus

##### Figure 2 : Response to monochromatic stimulus

First let's inspect all possibles cones responses to monochromatic stimulation. We can plot on a 3D axis the values $\{S_S(\lambda), S_M(\lambda), S_L(\lambda)\}$ with $\lambda \in \[ 400 nm, 800 nm\]$. Let's call this set $\mathcal{R}_{mono}$


##### Figure 3 : The set of possible triplets of responses to monochromatic stimulus. On the left, the color shows the different lambda values (see the colorbar). On the right, the color is coded by the triplet $(r_l, r_m, r_s)$.

### Space of all responses

Because we assume that
+ any spectrum can be written as a distribution $I(\lambda)$ 
+ the sensitivy function is a linear mapping 
+ the maximum of sensitivy is reached by monochromatic stimulations,
  
the set of all possible triplets is equal to the **convex hull** $\mathcal{R}$ generated by the set $\mathcal{R}_{mono}$.

Even if any color is only an interpretation of the brain and we could argue that no color *exist*, we could keep this terminology to describe colors that are produced after a monochromatic stimulation. Following this definition, *existing* colors are the one in $\mathcal{R}_{mono}$, and the other existing colors are stricly inside the convex hull.
