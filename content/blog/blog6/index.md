description: "We're hearing more than we're seeing." 
summary: "After diving into color perception in the previous blog post, I got interested into understanding more another sensor that mammals have: hearing. Light is a electromagnetic wave, where sound is a mechanical one, but the comparison is relevant because both sound and light signals can be described as a spectrum of wavelenght."
