## Introduction

Once I read on the internet that the color pink didn't really exist, and I struggled to really accept this idea. This was the motivation into diving more in our understanding the human perception of colors. 

##### Cones 

The perception of light is due to photoreceptors cells, called cone and rod cells. Rod cells gives low intensity light perception, and cones cells gives high intensity light perception. Most humans have three kinds of cones, each sensitive to a different spectrum of lights, and the combination of those three signals analyzed by our brain gives the sensation of light.

From data collected from http://cvrl.ucl.ac.uk/cones.htm , we can plot the different sensitivy of those three cones, sensitives to either small (S_S), medium (S_M) or long (S_L) wavelenghts.
