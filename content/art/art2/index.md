I can't enough from Jim Croce's song *Time in a bottle*. His lyrics are so touching.
It's even heartbreaking given his life's story, that he died so young in a plane crash. His wife received after his death a letter from him, announcing he had decided to quit music. He wanted to spend more time with her and his daughter.

When I was in Brisbane participating to a painting event, I got inspired to make an animation for this beautiful song :)
Made on Procreate.
